# Who am I?

Udi Finkelstein
qinhpad@udifink.com

This program was originally developed by Luxferre at https://gitlab.com/suborg/qinpad
I have taken it, and optimized it for my needs (Qin F21 Pro, Hebrew/English only), and renamed it QinHPad

# What data is collected?

None.
QinHPad collects no data by itself, and definitely does not collect personal identifiable information. It runs locally on your phone, and requires only the minimum permissions required for specific tasks.
